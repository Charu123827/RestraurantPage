    <img src="./puran poli.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300">
    <p>This delectable food item is a sweet version of the loving parantha. The stuffing is made from jaggery (gur),
        yellow gram (chana) dal, plain flour, cardamom powder and ghee (clarified butter). It is a popular dish in
        festive occasions and also can be eaten at any time of the day. A tasty dessert does not need anyone's
        permission to be eaten!</p><br>
