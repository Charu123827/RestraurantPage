    <p>Idli or idly is a type of savory rice cake, originating from the Indian subcontinent, popular as a breakfast food
        in Southern India and in Sri Lanka. The cakes are made by steaming a batter consisting of fermented black
        lentils and rice.
        Traditionally, each region has its own version, and it is usually served with sambar (spiced lentil stew) and
        coconut
        chutney. Some of the new contemporary variations are button idli, tatte idli, sanna idli, rava idli, and masala
        idli.</p><br>
