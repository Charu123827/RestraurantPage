    <h4>Dosa</h4>
    <img src="./Dosa-1.jpg.webp" alt="" width="300" height="300">
    <p>Rice and wheat are the top two grains consumed by Indians, with rice topping the list. Indians have taken this
        humble grain and transformed it into a plethora of sweet and savory dishes unlike any other culture in the
        world. The humble dosa is an ode to the never-ending love between the people of this country and rice.
        Dosa is the ever-popular South Indian breakfast of crispy crepes made with fermented rice and lentil batter. It
        is usually poured into a thin crispy crepe and served with a side of mashed spiced potatoes, lentil stew called
        sambar, and coconut chutney.</p><br>
