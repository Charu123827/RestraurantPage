    <h4>Sabudana khichdi</h4>
    <img src="./sabudana.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300">
    <p>Sabudana is 'sago' or tapioca starch. Khichdi roughly means 'mixture'. This unique dish is a popular breakfast
        item in Maharashtra food and cuisine and is one of the few food products which is consumed during the period of
        holy-fasting, 'upwaas'. The granular texture of sago prepared in a savoury mix turns out to be a delicious dish
        indeed.</p><br>
