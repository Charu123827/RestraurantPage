    <img src="./gathiya.avif" alt="" width="300" height="300">
    <p>Gujarat has a gem known as Gathiya. This traditional food of Gujarat has transcended regional boundaries to
        captivate taste buds across the country. These delightful bites are crafted from chickpea flour and fried to a
        beautiful dark yellow hue, offering a crunchy texture that remains pleasantly soft. Unlike many fried snacks
        that can become hard, Gathiya retains its inviting texture. For those with a sweet tooth, a delectable variant
        of Gathiya offers a sweet twist to this savoury treat. Whether enjoyed with morning tea or as an evening snack,
        Gathiya invites you to experience rich and diverse flavours.</p><br>
