    <h4>Thepla</h4>
    <img src="./theplka.avif" alt="" width="300" height="300">
    <p>Theplas are flatbreads crafted from gram flour, fenugreek leaves, and various spices. They are somewhat similar
        to thin Parathas enjoyed for breakfast. A Gujarat trip would be incomplete without savouring Thepla, an
        important dish of the traditional Gujarati cuisine. Best enjoyed whenever Theplas reach new heights of
        deliciousness when paired with a steaming cup of tea. Mango pickle provides the perfect complement for those
        yearning for an accompaniment. While Theplas are traditionally made with fenugreek leaves, those seeking variety
        can explore options such as Spinach and Radish variations.</p>
