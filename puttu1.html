    <p>Puttu is a breakfast dish eaten in the South Indian states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and parts of Karnataka, as well
        as in Sri Lanka. Puttu means “portioned” in Tamil and Malayalam. It is a dish made of steamed cylinders of
        ground rice layered with coconut shavings, sometimes with a sweet or savory filling. Puttu is served hot with
        sweet side dishes such as palm sugar or banana, or with curries including dal, chickpea, mutton, fish, chicken,
        or beef curry.
        Puttu principally consists of coarsely ground rice, grated coconut, a little salt, and water. It is often spiced
        with cumin but may have other spices. The Sri Lankan variant is usually made with wheat flour or red rice flour
        without cumin, whereas the Bhatkal recipes have plain coconut or masala variants made with mutton or
        shrimp-flavored grated coconut.</p><br>
